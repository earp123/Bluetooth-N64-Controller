# Bluetooth-N64-Controller
 Open Source files for a pair of Teensy 4s and a pair of Nordic SoCs that implement a custom [Joybus](https://n64brew.dev/wiki/Joybus_Protocol) driver and accompanying Bluetooth interface between a Nintendo 64 and its controller. This repository contains arduino code for the Teensys, arduino code for adafruit bluetooth kits using nordic BLE UART service, and additional C firmware for a custom Joybus Bluetooth service for a higher quality interface built on an NRF52840 DK from Nordic Semiconductor.
