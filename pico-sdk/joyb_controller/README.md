## Controller-side Transmitter Application
Two state machines are configured in this application. The first is used to drive an encoded poll signal out to the controller's data line, requesting the input state of the controller. The application must then switch the data pin direction to read the input response. The other state machine then measures the pulse widths of each of the 32 bits of response data that are mapped to the 15 buttons and two bytes for joystick X and Y  position. The 32 bit word is pushed to a FIFO and sent to btstack.
