# Bluetooth-N64-Controller
Open Source files for a pair of Teensy 4s and a pair of Nordic SoCs that implement a custom [Joybus](https://n64brew.dev/wiki/Joybus_Protocol) driver and accompanying Bluetooth interface between a Nintendo 64 and its controller. This is a prototype repository that contains arduino code for the Teensys and adafruit bluetooth kits that use the nordic BLE UART service.
